N-body barnes-hut simulation

To-do:

Switch image output to 1280x720

Upload to youtube in HD

Write galaxy init tool

Use Verlet integration

Calculate correct scaling for G

Set particles' opacity

Expand simulation box size so particles don't leave

Output ETA

Streamline getting output from noether

Parallelize simulation

Parallelize vis.py

Color pixels based on the particles' velocity

Vector functions vs macros

x Make images w/o pygame screen


x Get data or videos from noether to laptop

x Brute force -> Barnes-Hut

x Pass quad & other structs by reference

Dependencies:

pygame

ffmpeg
