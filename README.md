N-body barnes-hut simulation

To-do:

Improve how videos look on youtube

Write galaxy init tool

Use Verlet integration

Calculate correct scaling for G

Set particles' opacity

Output ETA

Streamline getting output from noether

Parallelize simulation

Parallelize vis.py

Color pixels based on the particles' velocity

Vector functions vs macros

x Upload to youtube in HD

x Expand simulation box size so particles don't leave

x Switch image output to 1280x720

x Make images w/o pygame screen

x Get data or videos from noether to laptop

x Brute force -> Barnes-Hut

x Pass quad & other structs by reference

Dependencies:

pygame

ffmpeg
