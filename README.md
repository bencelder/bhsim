N-body barnes-hut simulation

To-do:

Be able to start from a frame

Put a black hole in the center of the galaxy

Optimize timestep

Check smoothing term in force

Improve how videos look on youtube

Write galaxy init tool

Use Verlet integration

Calculate correct scaling for G

Set particles' opacity

Streamline getting output from noether

Parallelize simulation

Parallelize vis.py

Color pixels based on the particles' velocity

Vector functions vs macros

x Output ETA

x Upload to youtube in HD

x Expand simulation box size so particles don't leave

x Switch image output to 1280x720

x Make images w/o pygame screen

x Get data or videos from noether to laptop

x Brute force -> Barnes-Hut

x Pass quad & other structs by reference

Dependencies:

pygame

ffmpeg
